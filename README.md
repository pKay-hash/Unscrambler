# Unscrambler
A game within terminal that provides you with a board of letters that are scrambled from words taken from a dictionary. 
The amount of rows and columns in the board provided are chosen by the user, as well as the amount of times that the words should be scrambled.
One must unscramble the board to form the actual words using rotations of columns and rows. This implementation of this game allows one to undo their moves as well
using the implementation of linked lists.
